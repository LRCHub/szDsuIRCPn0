That won't fly
They won't come by
They won't fly
They won't come by
Mayday mayday mayday mayday oh my oh my
Mayday mayday mayday mayday oh my oh
A clothes pin on my tongue
Good lord it's cold
I feel you shivering shivering
Good lord it's cold
I feel you shivering shivering
As you lean across the racks i made you
You can do your puzzles
Yawn and say
Good bye
Good bye
Good bye
Good bye
I sprayed the outside
I smiled and took out the whole place
That won't fly
They won't come by
They won't fly
They won't come by
Mayday mayday mayday mayday oh my oh my
Mayday mayday mayday mayday oh my oh
A clothes pin on my tongue
Good lord it's cold
I feel you shivering shivering
Good lord it's cold
I feel you shivering shivering
I light the fuse and huck a few
I'll hold them off with a wiffle bat
If you let me
If you let me
