The spring is my love,
Hear the spring rustling in the trees,
Fill my heart with delight, rebirth of all kind,
Sceneries which fulfill my soul,
It will tranquilly last forever in my mind

The wind, the birds, the love, the air,
The breeze, the tune, the spring in me
The wind, the birds, the love, the air,
The breeze, the tune, the love in me
(Repeated several times)

The spring is my love

The wind, the birds, the love, the air,
The breeze, the tune, the spring in me
The wind, the birds, the love, the air,
The breeze, the tune, the love in me
(Repeated several times)
