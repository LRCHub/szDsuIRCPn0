# TheFatRat – MAYDAY

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Can you hear, can you hear, can
you hear my
voice?
Coming through, coming through,
coming
through the noise
I'm floating through outer space
I'm lost and I can't find a way
Oh, all the lights going dark
and my hope's
destroyed
Help me, is anybody there?
(Is anybody there? Is anybody
there?)
Save me, I'm running out of air,
ooh
Calling out mayday
Calling out mayday
It's so dark, it's so dark out
here in space
And it's been so long, been so
long since I've
seen a face
My eyes are shut but I can see
The void between you and me, mm
And I feeland I feel like I'm
going insane
Help me, is anybody there?
(Is anybody there? Is anybody
there?)
Save me, I'm running out of air,
ooh
Calling out mayday
Calling out mayday
Far from the sun
Beyond stars I hear their song
They're coming closer
Talking without sound
Calling me home
Calling out mayday
Calling out mayday
Save me, I'm running out of air
I'm running out of air
I'm running out of air
I'm running out of air
I'm running out of air
I'm running out of air
